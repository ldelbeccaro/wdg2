## Our story

We happened to meet briefly when we first moved to SF after college (via mutual friends) but didn't become close until we ended up at the same company. Ashkon would bribe Laura to help him with technical questions by offering her favorite candy, PEZ.
<br />
<br />
We became best friends when ski season started. Laura had a car and Ashkon convinced her to get a season pass with him. They continued to hang out all the time â€” Laura practically lived at Ashkon's apartment, working too much while Ashkon made too many cookies.
<br />
<br />
At some point, something finally clicked and we started dating. Now, our lives involve a lot of playing soccer, watching Chelsea games, and hosting lots of friends for game nights.
