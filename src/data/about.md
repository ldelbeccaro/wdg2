## Our story

We met briefly via friends when we first moved to SF after college, but didn't become close until we ended up at the same company. Ashkon would bribe Laura with candy to help him with technical questions.
<br />
<br />
We became best friends when ski season started. Laura had a car and Ashkon convinced her to get a season pass. They continued to hang out all the time â€” Laura practically lived at Ashkon's apartment (where he likes to say she used him for his in-unit laundry), working too much while Ashkon made too many cookies.
<br />
<br />
At some point, something clicked and we started dating. Now, our lives involve a lot of playing soccer, watching Chelsea games, and hosting friends for game nights ðŸ¤—
