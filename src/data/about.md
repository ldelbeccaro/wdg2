<strong>our story</strong>
Chances are not all of your guests know how the two of you met and when you decided to get married, so devote a section of your website recounting your love story and the proposal. Not sure where to start? Here are some tips on writing your “Our Story” section for your wedding website:
  Recounting your journey together as a couple is a great way to share those funny, memorable, and heartfelt moments that have defined who you are. You might want to include details about how you first met, your first date, your proposal story, what you love and admire most about your partner, and the most memorable experiences from your relationship so far. This section is particularly helpful for guests like distant relatives or plus-ones so they can get to know you both before the wedding day.
  Keep this section light and warm-hearted; a bit of playfulness and humor can be a great way to engage with your guests. You can write your story together as a couple, or relay your own versions to show two different points of view.
  Keep it brief. There's no need to write a novel—a couple of paragraphs that describe your first date, engagement story, and what you love about each other is all you need to provide guests with some insight into your relationship.

<strong>wedding parties</strong>
Many couples opt to include a section with a brief bio of wedding-party members describing how they know each person, along with a photo of each attendant.
