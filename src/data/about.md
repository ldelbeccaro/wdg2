## Our story

We happened to meet briefly via friends when we first moved to SF after college, but didn't become close until we ended up at the same company. Ashkon would bribe Laura to help him with technical questions by offering her favorite candy, PEZ.
<br />
<br />
We became best friends when ski season started. Laura had a car and Ashkon convinced her to get a season pass. They continued to hang out all the time — Laura practically lived at Ashkon's apartment, working too much while Ashkon made too many cookies.
<br />
<br />
At some point, something clicked (Ashkon likes to say he "climbed out of the friend zone") and we started dating. Now, our lives involve a lot of playing soccer, watching Chelsea games, and hosting friends for game nights 🤗
