This is where you can rsvp

Your RSVP section is where you can also ask questions regarding plus ones or dietary requirements. You can save yourself a whole lot of hassle later down the track by asking for these details upfront! If you’re lucky, you might even score a wedding website platform (like here at WedSites!) that automatically sends reminders to guests, so that you don’t have to chase up overdue RSVPs.

Do you have dietary restrictions
