  - change color of each menu item

          <div>
            image loads then giant 'welcome' fades onto screen then 'welcome'
            zooms out to become the title and the text of the message starts
            appearing (some animation for that? cooler typewriter animation?).
            at the same time maybe header shows up with menu options
