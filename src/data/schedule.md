timeline of events
  where and when
    maybe map animation with timeline
  dress code
  no invite-only events like rehearsal dinner

  For example, let your guests know what’s happening after the ceremony and how the evening will run. Do they need to make their way to a separate location, or will you be hosting celebratory drinks followed by a sit-down reception at the same venue? Make sure you provide the appropriate timings and locations for each aspect of your day, so guests are aware of where they need to be and when.

If you have organised a bus or coach to transport guests to and from your ceremony and reception location, use your wedding website to convey this information too. Clearly outline the meeting spot, the time the bus will be departing, and vice versa for the return trip.

Make sure you also include any relevant information regarding parking spots at the venue so that your guests are well aware of where they can leave their vehicles without obstructing your ceremony or reception access. There’s nothing worse than an MC running around trying to locate the owner of a double-parked vehicle halfway through the night!
